# Foobar Social Media App Wiki

## Overview
The Foobar project is a cutting-edge social network designed to enhance online interactions by allowing users to connect, share, and interact seamlessly. It integrates a bloom filter, utilizes a JavaScript server, and features a web frontend built with React, alongside an Android application developed in Android Studio.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Android Studio
- **Backend**: JavaScript server, cpp server
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Additional Technologies**: Bloom filters for efficient data queries

## Key Components

### 1. User Authentication
- **SignUp**: New users can register by providing a username, email, password, and profile picture.
- **SignIn**: Users log in to access their accounts.

### 2. User Interface
- **FeedPage**: Central hub for user activities, including viewing, posting, and interacting with posts.
- **Profile Management**: Users can customize their profiles and manage connections with other users.

### 3. Social Features
- **Posts and Comments**: Users can create posts and comment on other posts.
- **Friend Management**: Features include sending and receiving friend requests, which influence the visibility of posts and interactions.

## BloomFilter server  Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Open Terminal and Navigate to Project Folder**:
   ```
   cd path/to/project_folder
   ```

2. **Change to Source Directory**:
   ```
   cd src
   ```

3. **Compile the Project**:
   ```
   g++ -o bloomfilter ./Tcp.cpp ./App.cpp ./InputManagement.cpp ./BloomFilter.cpp ./HashCode.cpp ./AddAddress.cpp ./CheckAddress.cpp
   // Or compile all at once
   g++ -o bloomfilter ./*.cpp
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```
   ./bloomfilter
   ```

## Development Process
- **Division of Work**: Split into four main parts:
  1. **Testing**: Includes various unit tests for functionality.
  2. **Implementation**: Development of classes and associated tests.
  3. **Main Method and Refactoring**: Focuses on code optimization and maintainability.
  4. **CI/CD Workflow**: Setting up Docker and GitHub workflows for integration and deployment.

## Refactoring Details
- **Separation of Concerns**: Extracted `addAddress` and `checkAddress` from the `BloomFilter` class and turned them into standalone classes following the ICommand design pattern.
- **HashCode Implementation**: Decoupled hashing functionality from the `BloomFilter` class for better modularity.
- **Input Management**: Introduced a class to handle and validate user input efficiently.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment
- **Docker Integration**: Created a DockerHub account and set up a Docker workflow.
- **GitHub Actions**: Implemented CI/CD workflows to ensure compatibility across different platforms and environments.

## Server Setup

### Overview
The Foobar Server App is crucial for handling all backend functionalities, structured following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

### Project Structure
- **Model**: Handles CRUD operations for users, posts, and authentication tokens.
- **Controller**: Manages route handlers for incoming HTTP requests.

### Setup and Configuration
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Eliaddr119/Foobar-Server.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Server**:
   ```
   node app.js
   ```
## Handling TCP Connection Issues

If the server fails to connect via TCP, it might be due to an incorrect or inaccessible IP address. Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

1. **Identify Your Computer's IP Address**:
   - On Windows, open Command Prompt and enter the command:
     ```
     ipconfig
     ```
   - On Ubuntu, open Terminal and enter the command:
     ```
     ifconfig
     ```
   Look for the `IPv4 Address` on Windows or the `inet` address under your network interface on Ubuntu. This address represents your local IP.

2. **Update Server Configuration**:
   - Modify the `IP_ADDRESS_TCP` setting in your server configuration - config\.env.local to match the IP address you identified. This adjustment ensures that the server attempts to connect using the correct local network IP.

By ensuring the correct IP address is used, you can enhance the server's ability to establish a reliable TCP connection. This step is crucial for maintaining connectivity and should resolve common issues related to network configurations.
"""

### MongoDB Connection
- **Database URL**:
  ```
  MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/foobar_db
  ```

## Web Application Setup

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Eliaddr119/foobar_part2_web.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```
   cd foobar
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

This command will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload automatically when you make changes. You will also need to run the server and Mongo DB.


## Android Application Setup

### Cloning and Opening
1. **Clone the Android Repository**:
   ```
   git clone -b part4_error_message_when_link_corrupt https://github.com/Eliaddr119/Foobar-part2-Android.git
   ```
2. **Open with Android Studio**:
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Select "Open an Existing Project".
   - Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and open it.

### Environment Setup and Configuration
- **Gradle Sync**:
  - Ensure that Android Studio performs a Gradle sync automatically when the project is opened. This will setup all the necessary dependencies as defined in the project’s `build.gradle` files.
- **SDK and Build Tools**:
  - Verify that the Android SDK and build tools versions specified in `build.gradle` are installed and properly configured in Android Studio.

### Running the App
- **Device Selection**:
  - Connect an Android device via USB or set up an emulator through Android Studio’s AVD Manager.
- **Build and Run**:
  - Press the 'Run' button in Android Studio. Choose the connected device or an emulator to build and run the app.
